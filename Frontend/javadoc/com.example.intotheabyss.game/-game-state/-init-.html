<p>GameState acts as the barrier between the front end game logic and the back end networking logic. Both ends utilize
listeners which will constantly check and modify GameState based on what the server is telling the client or vice-
versa.</p>
<p>GameState only holds values/objects/hashmaps and does not contain any methods to manipulate data.</p>
<p>Doing this allows for a greater degree of modularity as the game logic has no knowledge or access to manipulate the
networking, and the networking should have no knowledge of the game logic itself. By doing this we could theoretically
swap out the game logic or the networking and the other parts should be none the wiser and the game should keep on
running just as it had before.</p>
